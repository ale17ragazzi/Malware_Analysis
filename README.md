# Malware_Analysis

In this repository you'll find analysis of real-world binaries. On each sample I've conducted Basic Static & Dynamic analysis, Disassembly, and Debugging. I still find myself at a early stage of my malware analysis study path. The analysis might not be exhaustive. For further documentation, please refer to the appropriate resources. Don't hesitate to contact me if you are willing to help or give some advice.
